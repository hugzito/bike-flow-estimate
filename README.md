# bike-flow-estimate
Code Repository for Master's Thesis by Christian Hugo Rasmussen &amp; Manuel Knepper. 

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for our master's thesis project, which focuses on **predicting and analyzing bike flow in the city of Copenhagen** using **graph learning techniques** such as **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** and **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Model and predict bike flow across the urban road network in Copenhagen.
- Leverage graph-based deep learning architectures (GCN and GAT) to capture both topological and feature-based dependencies.
- Evaluate model performance and explainability through feature importance analysis and case studies.

## Using Docker

Navigate to the docker/ folder and build the container:
```
cd docker
docker build -t bike-flow-estimate .
```

Then run the container:
```
docker run -it --rm bike-flow-estimate
```


## Data

The project relies on data about the road network, bike flow, and relevant features. Due to potential licensing or privacy restrictions, this data is **not included** in the repository. However, you can **recreate or obtain the data** as follows:

1. **Road Network**  
   - Source: [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)  
   - Recommended extraction: Use the [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) Python package to download the road network for Copenhagen.

2. **Bike Flow Data**  
   - Source: City of Copenhagen Open Data Portal or relevant bike counting stations.  
   - Download the bike flow data in CSV format or via API if available.

3. **Node Features**  
   - Combine the road network and bike flow data using the preprocessing steps defined in `scripts/bike-functions.py` and related notebooks.  

4. **Data Preparation**  
   - Use the notebooks (e.g., `notebooks/network-construction.ipynb`) and scripts to preprocess and merge the datasets into the format required for model training.

### Expected Directory Structure
Once the data is prepared, it should be placed in the following structure:
